    "#### SIR Model\n",
    "A SIR model is a description of the behavioral patterns of infectious disseases with the help of a set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Depending on the dissease that's being modeled, there are different types of SIR models that can be implemented. The model that we use is divided into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Susceptible; A group within the population that is susceptible to infection with the dissease.\n",
    "2.  Infected; A group within the population that is currently infected with the dissease\n",
    "3.  Recovered; A group that has recovered from an infection, we assume they cannot be infected again\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate with which people transfer between these categories is described by parameters. The parameters we use are called the infection rate (beta) and recovery rate (gamma) that describe the flow of susceptible to infected (beta) and of infected to recovered (gamma). Additionally, birth and death rates are introduced to describe the effect of 'fresh' additions to the population to the susceptible pool and a chance of mortality at each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of ODEs describe how the populations within these categories change over time due to the applied parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gillespie's Algorithm\n",
    "A Gillespie's Algorithm (GA) stochastically simulates discrete events from the equation it is applied to. In our application we used the so-called First Reaction Method where the rate at which an event occurs is passed to calculate how long it takes for the event to occur. To this determination, a random variable is attached to add stochasticity. The event that takes the least amount of time to occur is then executed, all other events are negated. The time that passed is updated to include the time it took for the event to occur and a new event is generated. This is repeated until the predetermined end-point is reached (such as an established end-time).\n",

    "With the help of the NetworkX library a random graph using the BA method of attaching nodes is created. By supplying the graph to the Network Diffusion Library (NDlib), a SIR model is created through setting up the appropriate parameters through functions supplied by the Configuration class of NDLib. The model is iterated t_span amount of times, after which the appropriate data is returned. To create a BA network, we supply a variable m which indicates the number of edges to attach from a new node to an existing node. "

Additionally, we also want to compare this with changing values for the basic reproductive number (R0). List for these parameters are supplied to a function that will iterate over the lists in seperate functions and run the Barabasi-Albert (BA) network for each value set a specified of times. Data from the BA network is returned and lists of the maximum mean and standard deviations of the number of infected nodes is generated.

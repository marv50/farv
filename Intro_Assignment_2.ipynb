    "#### SIR Model\n",
    "A SIR model is a description of the behavioral patterns of infectious disseases with the help of a set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Depending on the dissease that's being modeled, there are different types of SIR models that can be implemented. The model that we use is divided into three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Susceptible; A group within the population that is susceptible to infection with the dissease.\n",
    "2.  Infected; A group within the population that is currently infected with the dissease\n",
    "3.  Recovered; A group that has recovered from an infection, we assume they cannot be infected again\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate with which people transfer between these categories is described by parameters. The parameters we use are called the infection rate (beta) and recovery rate (gamma) that describe the flow of susceptible to infected (beta) and of infected to recovered (gamma). Additionally, birth and death rates are introduced to describe the effect of 'fresh' additions to the population to the susceptible pool and a chance of mortality at each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of ODEs describe how the populations within these categories change over time due to the applied parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Gillespie's Algorithm\n",
    "A Gillespie's Algorithm (GA) stochastically simulates discrete events from the equation it is applied to. In our application we used the so-called First Reaction Method where the rate at which an event occurs is passed to calculate how long it takes for the event to occur. To this determination, a random variable is attached to add stochasticity. The event that takes the least amount of time to occur is then executed, all other events are negated. The time that passed is updated to include the time it took for the event to occur and a new event is generated. This is repeated until the predetermined end-point is reached (such as an established end-time).\n",

    "## 5. Dynamic Vaccination Campaign\n",
    "A network containing predetermined node and edge structure was provided to be modelled in a SIR system and to which a vaccination strategy was to be applied. To ascertain the effectiveness of the strategy, we first designed a random null strategy. The null strategy should then be outperformed by the designed strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within each strategy, it is predetermined that we do not know the status of each node until a node is tested. The status a node can have is either 0 (susceptible), 1 (infected) or 2 (removed). Only susceptible nodes can be vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain limitations are set upon the strategy. There are a limited number of tests (200) and We can only test a specific (although not further specified) number of nodes per iteration of the SIR model. However, tests can have an accuracy rating from 0.25 ton 1.0. An inaccurate test will return a node's status as '1' when it is '0' and vice versa. We assume that recovered nodes always return the correct status. Per iteration, it is also possible to vaccinate a limited amount of susceptible people and their status is changed to removed immediately and indefinitely. "

    "First, the provided dataset is loaded correctly and initialised using the corresponding NDLib and NetworkX libraries. Edges between nodes from the dataset were generated per node. Two graphs were generated, one containg the 'true' graph data and one graph signifying the data that we know since we can only assume a node status after testing but we need the actual data for running an accurate simulation. To keep the distinction clear, we generated two graphs. To the known graph, the 'status' opf a node was added to each node such that their data is accesible. All the nodes in the 'known graph' are first set to 0 (susceptible), assuming that every node we have not tested and/or vaccinated yet is susceptible."
